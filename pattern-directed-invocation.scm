;;; A rule, in this terminology, is a pattern and a handler.  The
;;; pattern determines the applicability of the rule and the match
;;; bindings that enable it, and the handler can compute an arbitrary
;;; value from them.  Once constructed, a rule is a procedure that
;;; accepts a datum, and returns either the datum if the pattern
;;; doesn't match or the value of the handler when applied to the
;;; dictionary if it does.  The input datum is used as the sentinel
;;; value for failure because in the context of term rewriting,
;;; succeeding with the input as the answer is equivalent to failing.

;;; The handler can reject a putative match by returning #f, which
;;; causes backtracking into the matcher, and may cause the handler to
;;; be called again with different bindings.  If the handler always
;;; returns #f, the rule may fail even though its pattern matched.
;;; The handler can force success with an arbitrary object (including
;;; #f) by returning the result of calling `succeed' on the value to
;;; return.

;;; For situations where it is desirable to distinguish rule failure
;;; from success with the input, the rule procedure accepts an
;;; optional second argument to use as a token to indicate failure.
;;; If the second argument is given, it is returned on failure, and
;;; the input datum (along with all other objects) indicates success.
;;; The token is not stored and is not passed to handlers.  It is up
;;; to the caller to make sure that this token is unique.
