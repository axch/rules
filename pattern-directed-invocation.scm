;;; A rule, in this terminology, is a pattern and a handler.  The
;;; pattern determines the applicability of the rule and the match
;;; bindings that enable it, and the handler can compute an arbitrary
;;; value from them.  Once constructed, a rule is a procedure that
;;; accepts a datum, and returns either #f if the pattern doesn't
;;; match or the value of the handler when applied to the dictionary
;;; if it does.  This code contains a solution to the consequent
;;; sentinel value issue, but I don't like it.
