;;; will apply them repeatedly to all possible subexpressions of the
;;; given expression, and to the expression itself, replacing any
;;; successful match with the output of that rule, until no further
;;; rules match.  Of course, the rules in question should be arranged
;;; so as to ensure that this process terminates in a reasonable
;;; amount of time.
