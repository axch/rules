;;;;           Most General Generic-Operator Dispatch

(declare (usual-integrations))

;;; Generic-operator dispatch is implemented here by a discrimination
;;; list, where the arguments passed to the operator are examined by
;;; predicates that are supplied at the point of attachment of a
;;; handler (by ASSIGN-OPERATION).

;;; To be the correct branch all arguments must be accepted by
;;; the branch predicates, so this makes it necessary to
;;; backtrack to find another branch where the first argument
;;; is accepted if the second argument is rejected.  Here
;;; backtracking is implemented by OR.

;;; The discrimination list has the following structure: it is a
;;; possibly improper alist whose "keys" are the predicates that are
;;; applicable to the first argument.  If a predicate matches the
;;; first argument, the cdr of that alist entry is a discrimination
;;; list for handling the rest of the arguments.  If a discrimination
;;; list is improper, then the cdr at the end of the backbone of the
;;; alist is the default handler to apply (all remaining arguments are
;;; implicitly accepted).
