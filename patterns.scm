;;;; Matcher based on match combinators, CPH/GJS style.
;;;     Idea is in Hewitt's PhD thesis (1969).

;;; There are match procedures that can be applied to data items.  A
;;; match procedure either accepts or rejects the data it is applied
;;; to.  Match procedures can be combined to apply to compound data
;;; items.

;;; A match procedure takes a data item, a dictionary, and a success
;;; continuation.  The dictionary accumulates the assignments of match
;;; variables to values found in the data.  The success continuation
;;; takes the new dictionary as an argument.  If a match procedure
;;; fails it returns #f.

;;; Primitive match procedures

;; Match a pattern constant (by eqv?)
(define (match:eqv pattern-constant)
  (define (eqv-match data dictionary succeed)
    (and (eqv? data pattern-constant)
	 (succeed dictionary)))
  eqv-match)

;; Match a pattern variable, as long as the datum satisfies all the
;; restriction predicates.
(define (match:element variable restrictions)
  (define (ok? datum)
    (every (lambda (restriction)
	     (restriction datum))
	   restrictions))
  (define (element-match data dictionary succeed)
    (and (ok? data)
	 (let ((vcell (dict:lookup variable dictionary)))
	   (if vcell
	       (and (equal? (dict:value vcell) data)
		    (succeed dictionary))
	       (succeed (dict:bind variable data dictionary))))))

;;; Segment variables introduce some additional trouble.  Unlike other
;;; matchers, a segment variable is not tested against a fixed datum
;;; that it either matches or not, but against a list such that it may
;;; match any prefix.  This means that in general, segment variables
;;; must search, trying one match and possibly backtracking.  There
;;; are, however, two circumstances when the search can be avoided: if
;;; the variable is already bound, the bound value needs to be checked
;;; against the data, but no guessing as to how much data to consume
;;; is required.  Also, if the segment variable is the last matcher in
;;; its enclosing list (which actually happens quite often!) then the
;;; list matcher already knows how much data must be matched, and no
;;; search is needed.

;;; How should the bound values of segment variables be represented?
;;; The naive approach would just be to copy the segment of the list
;;; that is bound --- that is, notionally, the value, after all.
;;; However, this introduces an unnecessary linear slowdown in the
;;; case when the current guess as to the length of the segment is
;;; proven false without needing to examine the bound variable, for
;;; instance if the next matcher doesn't match.  Therefore, segment
;;; variables should be represented as pointers to the beginning and
;;; end of the data in the segment, whence the actual list value can
;;; be derived when needed.

;;; Finally, the list matcher needs to behave differently when giving
;;; data to a segment as opposed to a regular matcher: the segment
;;; should be given the whole (remaining) list in contrast with just
;;; the first data item for the regular matcher, and the segment may
;;; (in fact, probably will) consume more than one element, so it
;;; needs to pass the data remaining to its success continuation.  All
;;; matchers could be made uniform by giving them all the interface of
;;; the segment matcher, but I think it's less ugly to take advantage
;;; of the fact that segment matchers can only occur as submatchers of
;;; list matchers and make their interface special.
