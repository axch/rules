;;;; Rules

;;; A rule is a pattern and a handler.  The pattern determines the
;;; applicability of the rule, and the match bindings that enable said
;;; applicability, and the handler can compute an arbitrary value from
;;; them.  Once constructed, a rule is a procedure that accepts a
;;; datum, and returns either the datum if the pattern doesn't match
;;; or the value of the handler when applied to the dictionary if it
;;; does.  The input datum is used as the sentinel value for failure
;;; because in the context of term rewriting, succeeding with the
;;; input as the answer is equivalent to failing.

;;; The handler can reject a putative match by returning #f, which
;;; causes backtracking into the matcher, and may cause the handler to
;;; be called again with different bindings.  If the handler always
;;; returns #f, the rule may fail even though its pattern matched.
